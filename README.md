Covid-Track has no database, instead all the Covid 19 data is pulled straight from CSV file provided to us by the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center 
for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. [Click here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) to visit the repo.
The web app has been created primarily using Java version 11 under the Spring Boot framework. For the Frontend, HTML5 has been used for the markup and 
BootStrap v4.6 has been used to give the web app a responsive UI.
